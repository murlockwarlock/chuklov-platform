# Testing Strategy

- Unit: pure invariants/value objects/context behavior.
- Feature: HTTP/Inertia, policies, application actions, Filament foundations, faked external AI/providers.
- Integration: real PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis/queues, and private storage.
- E2E: Playwright desktop/mobile/Mini App and critical business paths as milestones implement them.
- Security: cross-organization/client, IDOR, forged identity/webhook, replay, upload, payment tampering, log/payload leakage.

Use focused tests during development, `make quality` before task completion, and `make ci` at milestone/merge/release. Never replace PostgreSQL-specific integration coverage with SQLite.
